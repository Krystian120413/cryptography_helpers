# Cryptography Helpers

Here are some helpers for cryptography beginners (and students) in Python

* `engram_score.py` file is from the [`python_cryptoanalisis`](https://github.com/jameslyons/python_cryptanalysis/blob/master) repo and it's updated to python3
* `english_bigrams.txt` file is from the [`enigma`](https://github.com/torognes/enigma/tree/master) repo (you can find there more bigrams, monograms, trigrams, and quadgrams in different languages)
