# Cryptography Helpers

Here are some helpers for cryptography beginners (and students) in Python

* `engram_score.py` file is from the [`python_cryptoanalisis`](https://github.com/jameslyons/python_cryptanalysis/blob/master) repo and it's updated to python3
* `english_bigrams.txt` file is from the [`enigma`](https://github.com/torognes/enigma/tree/master) repo (you can find there more bigrams, monograms, trigrams, and quadgrams in different languages)
* Samples are from the [`Article Factory`](https://www.articlesfactory.com/)
* `usage` directory includes:
  * `hill_climbing.py` - function used to crack enciphered text
  * `consts.py` - constants used across files
  * `encrypt.py` - enciphering and deciphering functions
  * `text_samples` - samples in `.txt` format
  * `samples.py` - read samples
